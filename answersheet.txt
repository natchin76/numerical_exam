Answer sheet


Prob2:
C:
The maximum number that can be stored in int data type is 2141483647, hence 
the given number can't be stored using int. We can use unsigned int or long int.

Python:
int can store any huge number. I tried saving the given number in python as 
int and it worked. Thus int is enough to store the given value.

Prob3:
C: Library: gsl_integration.h

Python: Library: scipy.integrate
        Function: romberg()
        
Prob4:
C: Library: gsl_roots.h
   Function:gsl_root_fsolver_bisection
Python: Library scipy.optimize
   Function:bisect   
   
Prob5:
Inferred value of theta:0.5707722851547312
